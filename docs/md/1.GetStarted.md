**Byakko** is framework that allows you to create more controllable flow for [SPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) using built-in tools and required external libraries:

1. **[Preact](https://preactjs.com/)** - As first point you need to use some library that is compatible with React API. You don't have to use React itself. Actually Preact is much much faster.

2. **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** - TypeScript allows us to create our code more readable and safe. It's required because of e.g decorators.

3. **[MobX](https://mobx.js.org/)** - MobX is powerful tool to create seamless storages/models in this frontend world. MobX itself performance aside, have single big problem. Programmers can mess up all flow by accident and create hell of loops. Byakko will help you to keep clean data flow.

Byakko's second greatest advantage is the concept that mix multiple needed programming design patterns in cleanest possible way.
