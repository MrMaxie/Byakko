We need of course to install required libraries and Byakko itself:

```bash
npm install --save-exact byakko typescript mobx preact mobx-react
```

Also we need to set-up some compilation flow. You can to use TypeScript compilation ifself or some packing library like [Fuse-Box](https://fuse-box.org/).

Thats all!
