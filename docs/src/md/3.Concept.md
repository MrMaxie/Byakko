One of the most important thing in this project is concept of data flow. Generally in JS enviroments you don't have any predefinited structure. It's very flexible way, but it's easier to create mess. It's awesome when you can create own structure by basing on your needs, but, to be honest, in most cases in such dynamicaly created structures by multiple people, you can go crazy at searching something where what is located and how it exacly works. MVVM (Model View View-Model) magnifies this effect by mixing two worlds in a boundless way - the world of the interface and the world of data.

Byakko don't create borders for that flexibility, instead of that it rewards following the dreamiest path.

So Byakko splits all things into small pieces to keep everything on correct place.

Most elements are common and well known, but don't be fooled, Byakko has a slightly different approach to it.
